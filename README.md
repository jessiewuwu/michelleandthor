# MichelleandThor.com :love_letter:
Think tumblr but built with Rails and React - an aggregator leading up to Michelle and Thor's wedding with photos from #michelleandthor tags, compiled guest messages, and gifs.

## user stories :bust_in_silhouette:
* A user can view tagged photos from Instagram
* A user can add a gif based on keyword(s)
* A user can add a limited-count message

## mvp :new_moon:
* Use the Instagram API for tagged photos
* Use the Giphy API for gifs
* No limit for the character count on the message
* Find a way to get it hosted on michelleandthor.com with heroku? Digital Ocean? 

## mvp next :waxing_crescent_moon:
* Use Facebook API for tagged photos
* Add a limit to how many results show up for the searched gif keyword
* Infinite scrolling

## mvp almost: :first_quarter_moon:
* Use the loading gif preview library (if we don't use this, will the page load too slowly? if yes, use it. if no, move to nice-to-have's)
* Style different lengths of messages differently (fancy cursive fonts for x characters, sans-serif for x+ characters)
* Message topics of the week e.g. what makes a long, happy marriage? what do you think thor loves most about michelle? what makes michelle a great wife? how did you know they were meant to be together? what is your favorite memory of michelle and thor? what do you want to wish for the happy couple? 

## mvp done: :full_moon:
* Present it during the wedding

## nice-to-have's
* Allow users to upload photos in the app - AWS storage, file uploader component
* Add a character counter for the message
* Allow videos from Instagram and Facebook to be embedded
