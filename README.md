# michelleandthor.com :love_letter:
Think tumblr but built with Rails and React - a photo aggregator from #michelleandthor tags, guest messages, and gifs.

## user stories :bust_in_silhouette:
* A user can view tagged photos from Instagram
* A user can add a gif based on keyword(s)
* A user can add a limited-count message

## mvp :new_moon:
* Use the Instagram API for tagged photos
* Use the Giphy API for gifs
* No limit for the character count on the message
* Infinite scrolling

## mvp next :waxing_crescent_moon:
* Use Facebook API for tagged photos
* Add a limit to how many results show up for the searched gif keyword
* Add a character counter for the message

## mvp almost: :first_quarter_moon:
* Allow users to upload photos in the app - AWS storage, file uploader component
* Allow videos from Instagram and Facebook to be embedded
* Use the loading gif preview library
* Style different lengths of messages differently 

## mvp done: :full_moon:
* Find a way to get it hosted on michelleandthor.com with heroku? Digital Ocean?
